If you want to clone the code, be sure to switch to the test branch (code not yet pushed to master, i.e., production).

It is possible to run this code locally, but you will need the file dev.js (ask me, emerysolutions@yahoo.co.uk) as this contains the private keys for MongoDB and Google (and some other keys we don't use yet). This goes in the /server/config folder.

To run, cd into the server directory and use the command "npm run dev".

Note that this repo contains only the web server code, the blockchain code is in the separate fabric repo
